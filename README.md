# Bushfire Analysis using Meteorological Data : Project Overview 

In this project:
- Conducted data exploration.
- Tested and treated outliers.
- Built a linear regression model.
- Enhanced the linear regression model using varies teqniques.
- Built a Random Forest model.
- Built a Boosted Tree model.
- Compared the three models and chose the best one in terms of performance. 
- Highlghted the variable importance using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Boosted Tree model.
